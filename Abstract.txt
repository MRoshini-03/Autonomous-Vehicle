Abstract
An autonomous robot is an intelligent device capable of automatically detecting obstacles in its path and avoiding them by altering its direction. When the robot encounters an obstacle, it changes its course and continues to move, allowing it to navigate unknown environments without collisions, which is essential for any autonomous mobile robot. This technology is widely used in various fields, including military operations, where robots perform high-risk tasks that are too dangerous for soldiers. The robot in this project is developed using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino, with the ultrasonic sensor detecting obstacles by measuring the distance between the robot and the objects in its path. The system’s performance is tested and evaluated based on its accuracy in obstacle detection and avoidance, including parameters such as speed, range, turning radius, and stability. The obstacle avoidance robotic vehicle has applications in home automation, surveillance, and manufacturing industries, where autonomous robots can enhance safety and efficiency. The project utilizes a microcontroller (ATmega328) to control the robotic vehicle's movement, demonstrating the potential of autonomous robots in reducing human error and saving lives in critical situations.

Working Principle
The working principle of the autonomous robot is based on the use of ultrasonic sensors and a microcontroller to enable obstacle detection and avoidance. When the robot is in operation, the ultrasonic sensor continuously emits sound waves and measures the time taken for these waves to bounce back after hitting an object. This data allows the robot to calculate the distance to the nearest obstacle. When an obstacle is detected within a predefined distance, the microcontroller (ATmega328) processes this information and sends commands to the motors to alter the robot’s direction, thereby avoiding collisions. The robot employs different movement algorithms, such as random walk or wall following, to navigate its environment efficiently. This autonomous navigation allows the robot to move safely and adaptively in various settings, such as homes, manufacturing facilities, or even hazardous environments. The ability of the robot to autonomously detect and avoid obstacles highlights its practical use in enhancing safety, reducing the need for human intervention, and performing complex tasks with precision.
